												<h2>Quotes That Tell A Story</h2>

											</header>
											<p>This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part.</p>
<p>Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence?</p>
<p>Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.</p>
<p>Recently, leaders in higher education, industry, government, foundations, and professional associations have encouraged the development of T-shaped students and professionals.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech looks to expand this model, creating "VT-shaped students.</p>
<p>To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination.</p>
<p>The greatest of land-grant institutions continue to integrate practical and liberal education, and they do so because technology never works without people as part of the equation, because innovation is fundamentally a human pursuit.</p>
<p>A T-shaped individual has deep knowledge of a discipline and/or way of thinking, often seen in higher education as a student's major.</p>
<p>An education from Virginia Tech goes beyond the “T” shape by incorporating elements of Ut Prosim and the land-grant mission to create a “VT-shaped individual.”</p>
<p>A Virginia Tech education will engage the whole person and through inclusive connections contribute to the value of each person and to the groups in which they participate.</p>
<p>Students at all levels will be mentored to develop a knowledge base and skills while they are immersed in a culture that unifies multiple disciplines in a field of study within the context of these crucial values.</p>
<p>The "V" enriches the model bringing in technological literacy, informal communal learning, and guided experiential learning.</p>
<p>The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics.</p>
<p>We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>Emerging from this work is the notion of a “purpose-driven and person-centered” curricular design.</p>
